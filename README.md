## Motivation
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is a critical tool for identifying cardiac abnormalities early, potentially saving lives through timely diagnosis and treatment. This project aims to enhance ECG analysis using data science, focusing on distinguishing normal heartbeats from defective ones by incorporating both ECG signal patterns and patient demographic information. By integrating age, gender, and clinical details, the goal is to uncover patterns that could improve diagnostic accuracy and provide deeper insights into cardiovascular health.

Previously, I attempted a similar project but encountered challenges in data handling and analysis. However, with my evolving skills in DSA 210, I am now better equipped to tackle these obstacles and develop a more refined approach.

## Data Sources
The primary datasets for this project come from PhysioNet, a widely used resource for medical research data. The main sources include:

- **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**: This dataset contains detailed ECG recordings from 290 patients, categorized as normal or showing various heart conditions, such as myocardial infarctions and arrhythmias. It also includes demographic details like age and gender, making it an excellent source for combining signal analysis with patient characteristics.
- **ECG 5000 Dataset**: Comprising over 14,000 ECG samples, this dataset provides a robust collection of labeled ECG readings, helping to strengthen the classification of normal vs. defective heartbeats.
- **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**: Used for cross-validation, this dataset consists of 48 half-hour ECG recordings with detailed beat-by-beat annotations, adding an extra layer of verification to my analysis.

These datasets will allow for a thorough examination of ECG signals in relation to patient demographics, potentially revealing trends in how different factors influence heart conditions.

## Data Collection and Processing Plan
To ensure high-quality, structured data, I will follow a multi-step approach:

1. **Data Extraction & Conversion**:
   - Download the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database from PhysioNet.
   - Use the `wfdb-python` package to convert the WFDB format files into a structured CSV file (`ecg_data.csv`).
   - Extract the first 5,000 samples per patient at 500 Hz, standardizing by selecting lead I for consistency.
   - Label each ECG entry as "Normal" or "Defective" based on the dataset’s diagnostic information.

2. **Demographic Data Processing**:
   - Extract age, gender, and any available clinical notes from the PTB metadata files.
   - Implement a script (`extract_metadata.py`) to clean and format demographic data into `demographics.csv`.
   - Ensure numerical age values and standardize gender representation (M/F).
   - Handle missing ages by imputing the dataset’s average age.

3. **Cross-Validation & Data Integration**:
   - Convert a subset of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database into `mitbih_data.csv`, selecting 5,000 beats for comparison.
   - Merge `ecg_data.csv` and `demographics.csv` into a master dataset (`master_ecg_data.csv`), aligning ECG readings with patient information based on patient ID.
   - Clean the dataset by filtering out anomalies such as extreme outliers and verifying label integrity against PhysioNet documentation.

4. **Data Storage & Version Control**:
   - Organize all datasets in a `/data` directory within a dedicated GitHub repository.
   - Commit progress systematically, maintaining clear documentation of data transformations and modifications.

## Tools and Technologies
To execute this project efficiently, I will leverage:

- **Python 3.11** for data processing and machine learning implementation.
- **pandas** for data manipulation and merging.
- **wfdb-python** to handle PhysioNet’s specialized ECG file formats.
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning-based classification and pattern analysis.
- **matplotlib & seaborn** for visualizing ECG signals and demographic trends.
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project organization.

## Expected Outcomes
This project will provide a structured pipeline for analyzing ECG signals alongside demographic information, with the potential to:

- Improve classification accuracy of normal vs. defective heartbeats.
- Identify correlations between patient demographics and heart conditions.
- Validate findings across multiple datasets to ensure robustness.
- Generate visual insights that highlight key patterns in ECG signals.

By successfully executing this project, I aim to contribute meaningful insights into ECG analysis, potentially aiding medical professionals in making more informed diagnostic decisions.
